It was my work towards an ergonomic site-generator for org-mode. I have more or less abandoned it, as I felt constrained by the Uniorg parser, but more to the point, I was concerned with the how of converting it from a very specific and custom site to one that could be used by anyone. I felt like the effort needed to take the Sylvan project to that point was fairly high, and there already existed a few better options.</description></item><item><title>Giving ox-hugo Another Try</title><link>http://example.org/blog/giving-ox-hugo-another-try/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 06:26:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/giving-ox-hugo-another-try/</guid><description>I am giving ox-hugo another try. A few reasons, primarily, my NextJS efforts started feeling like holding water in my hands, and second ox-hugo is just closer to the metal, so to speak. The site will probably change apperance for a while but I hope to get it back to a close approximation of what I have style-wise currently. This post will likely be shown on the NextJS version of the blog for a while and then once I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a deployment process setup I&amp;rsquo;ll switch to the Hugo site.</description></item><item><title>A Better Template Func</title><link>http://example.org/blog/a-better-template-func/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/a-better-template-func/</guid><description>In a previous post I talked about a function I wrote that allowed me to stub out a few of the properties required for working with Sylvan.

Content Layer is basically a way of reading MD and MDX files and then turning them into JSON that JavaScript can then process. In addition to reading markdown into data, Content Layer also does a few other things that other libraries aren&amp;rsquo;t offering. With Content Layer I can not only turn MD into data, but it also creates TypeScript typing for that data and allows you to extrapolate and generate metadata on the fly to go with that JSONified markdown.</description></item><item><title>Deployment.

Why? I like it!
I tried to use ox-hugo. And it seemed nice, but way to much extra. Org mode can compile org files to html, why convert the files to markdown first? Just didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. I think I shall try sticking with stock org-mode for publishing.
I ended up finding a wonderful package called Uniorg, which is a parser that takes Org files and generates Unified ASTs that can then be manipulated by tools like Rehype to modified and spit-out HTML.</description></item><item><title>My Dirty Hack to Template Files</title><link>http://example.org/blog/my-dirt-hack-to-template-files/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/my-dirt-hack-to-template-files/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of hard to use a template to create a new file.

As I&amp;rsquo;ve expressed before, I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% thrilled with Sylvan as it exists today As I&amp;rsquo;ve expressed before, I&amp;rsquo;d love for a more emacs-centric tooling, but I dislike the constraints of ox-html I am taking a new job on October 10th and my primary frontend framework will be lit.</description></item><item><title>Playing With Hugo</title><link>http://example.org/blog/playing-with-hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/playing-with-hugo/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time playing with Hugo and more specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with ox-hugo which is a way of exporting Org files to Markdown that plays nicely with Hugo.

I had migrated to Kubernetes when I was doing consulting work as an SRE however, I am now very focused on being a developer, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t wish to lose my SRE skillset, I also cannot justify the cost, maintenance, or cognitive load required to keep that cluster up and working, thus a VM.</description></item><item><title>Still Undecided</title><link>http://example.org/blog/still-undecided/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/still-undecided/</guid><description>Me, the jury of one, is still out on whether I will continue with the Uniorg+NextJS or attempt to find a different solution.
