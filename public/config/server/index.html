All of the source files for Lit Server are defined here and are “tangled” together with org-tangle. This is the only file that should ever be edited (other than the README).\nREADME.org It seems a little weird to build an org file, with an org file. I’m really only doing this because the server directory is entry built from this org file, but the intention is that I compile the files in server locally and commit them. There is a chance that someone – including future me – might come upon this server directory and be uninformed about it’s creation and use.\n#+title: Readme NOTICE: This file and all files in this directory were built with =server.org= and should not be directly edited! This is the server dir used to deploy my bitranchlabs server infra. Deploy There are a number of ways that this could be deployed. I think I will eventually settle on gitlab-ci, but incase I want to deploy from local I have come up with a solution using the package (emacs-ssh-deploy).\ndeploy.sh This is a simple shell script to deploy my server. It assumes all the files that are needed can be found in the remote path /opt/lit-server and it needs to be run as root.\ncp /home/ian/lit-server/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile cp /home/ian/lit-server/docker-compose.yml /opt/composed/docker-compose.yml cd /opt/composed/ docker-compose up -d systemctl reload caddy Makefile Emacs can run make files, that might be enough for local deployments… This sort of works actually, but the deploy-remote stuff seems to just always fail and then I have to ssh into the machine and run that exact same command. Sort of ridiculous tbh…\nCaddy has a --watch flag, might be worth looking at using that to watch for changes to the config. But it could also be a disaster, I’m not sure…\n.PHONE: all deploy deploy-local install sync setup, clean all: sync deploy-remote clean: ssh ian@server-01.bitranclabs.net rm -rf ~/lit-server deploy-local: cp /home/ian/lit-server/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile cp /home/ian/lit-server/docker-compose.yml /opt/composed/docker-compose.yml cd /opt/composed/ docker-compose up -d systemctl reload caddy deploy-remote: ssh root@server-01.bitranchlabs.net bash /home/ian/lit-server/deploy.sh install: deploy-remote setup: ssh ian@server-01.bitranchlabs.net mkdir -p /home/ian/lit-server ssh root@server-01.bitranchlabs.net mkdir -p /opt/composed sync: setup @echo \"Publishing to remote\" rsync -chazve ssh ~/org/server/ ian@server-01.bitranchlabs.net:~/lit-server/ emacs-ssh-deploy ARCHIVE Caddy We’re going to try using Caddy for the server for this. I was using Traefik in docker and it was just crapping out, so I gave up after much frustration and decided to put the server outisde of Docker. Caddy is a very straightforward server to setup but has a lot of features. Just an aside, I’m using “shell” for the src type on these blocks because org doesn’t know what a Caddyfile type is, and shell and Caddy share the same comment types (ie # ).\nGlobals Here are the global defaults for Caddy. Since Caddy comes with TLS by default, all we have to do is give it an email address:\n{ email ian@dapringles.com } These aren’t exactly “global” but they’re some defaults that’ll be used with mosta/all subsequent server configurations. First up “encoding”, some of these settings are the defaults, I am adding them for visibility:\n(encoding) { encode { zstd gzip } } Some default headers we want to upstream:\n(upheaders) { header_up X-Forwarded-Ssl on header_up X-Real-IP {remote} header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port} header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme} header_up X-Url-Scheme {scheme} header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host} } Services For the most part, the services Caddy is going to be serving are defined in the section on each server and then noweb will tangle them all into the Caddyfile for us.\nFile Server I think it would be nice to have a fileserver for anything I want to share or access. I’m not sure I will keep this up but it’s here for the time being.\nThis isn’t working right now actually…\nfiles.bitranchlabs.net { file_server browse { root * /static hide .git precompressed zstd br gzip import upheaders } import encoding } Services One thing of note here, since we’re exposing all the docker containers to localhost, we have to keep track of their ports or else there could be a collision and something will not be happy.\nBoilerplate We’ll be using docker-compose for most services.\nversion: '3.7' services: whoami This is a pretty worthless service beyond just basic troubleshooting and sanity checking. It’ll also serve as something of a “template” for creating other services I guess.\ndocker-compose.yaml First we need docker-compose file:\nwhoami: image: docker.io/containous/whoami:latest restart: always ports: - 8000:80 Caddyfile This is the definition of this service in our Caddyfile:\nwhoami.bitranchlabs.net { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000 { import upheaders } import encoding } Resume site This is my resume website, usually it can be found at https://ianpringle.org/. It can also be found at https://resume.bitranchlabs.net. No real reason for both, just something I like to do I guess…\ndocker-compose.yaml Make sure there is no collision on local host and then match that with port 80 inside the container:\nresume: image: registry.gitlab.com/pard/resume-site:latest restart: always ports: - 8001:80 Caddyfile This is the definition of this service in our Caddyfile:\nresume.bitranchlabs.net ianpringle.org { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8001 { import upheaders } import encoding } Ungovernable World docker-compose.yaml Make sure there is no collision on local host and then match that with port 80 inside the container:\nungovernable-world: image: docker.io/pard68/ungovernable restart: always ports: - 8002:80 Caddyfile This is the config for the actual site, we put the redirect block above it so that it can be properly redirected.\nungovernable.world { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8002 { import upheaders } import encoding } Bitranchlabs Blog docker-compose.yaml\nMake sure there is no collision on local host and then match that with port 80 inside the container:\nbrl-www: image: registry.gitlab.com/bitranchlabs/www:latest restart: always ports: - 8003:80 Caddyfile\nThis is for redirecting some URLs to the desired site.\nbitranchlabs.com, bitranchlabs.net, www.bitranchlabs.net, bitranchlabs.org, www.bitranchlabs.org { redir https://bitranchlabs.com{uri} } This is the config for the actual site, we put the redirect block above it so that it can be properly redirected.\nwww.bitranchlabs.com { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8003 { import upheaders } import encoding } API I use the bitranchlabs.com domain for some APIs. Because I route by path for these, the setup can be a bit complex (it isn’t currently, but if I add API that’ll change). In Caddy we will need to use a directive called handle to manage directing ports by path. These directives need to all be in the same block, so we’ll use some noweb for that.\napi.bitranchlabs.com { \u003c\u003e import encoding } Your Face API\ndocker-compose.yaml\nMake sure there is no collision on local host and then match that with port 80 inside the container:\nbrl-your-face-api: image: registry.gitlab.com/pard/yourface-api:master-1 restart: always ports: - 8004:80 Caddyfile\nThis maps that path specified to the port. We are using Caddy’s handle_path directive here because we want to strip that path being requested since the upstream microserve isn’t aware of paths and thinks it’s being served from /\nhandle_path /api/v1/yourface { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8004 { import upheaders } } Firewall ferm’s configuration is pretty straightforward, you tables and chains, you can specific a domain (ip, ipv6) for the table, and you can target specific predefined policies (ACCEPT, DROP, etc.). I am not a networking guy or a firewall guru, but I think I have enough understanding to write something…\n\u003c\u003e The filter Table We’ll write to the default table filter:\ntable filter { And we’ll start with the INPUT chain:\nchain INPUT { Seems like you start with a your catch-all, in this case I want to DROP anything that isn’t explicitly allowed, hopefully this will prevent some attacks just by not advertising this server exists.\npolicy DROP; I am still not entirely sure what “connection tracking” is or means, but this rules controls this and here is a brief synopsis of the idea.\nmod state state INVALID DROP; mod state state (ESTABLISHED RELATED) ACCEPT; This is rather self-explanatory, we allow local connections through the firewall, it probably is safe to say this won’t hurt, if an attacker is coming from local we got bigger fish to fry…\ninterface lo ACCEPT; Contrary to the default settings, I do not want to respond to ICMP:\nproto icmp icmp-type echo-request DROP; Now for the things that this server needs to have open. The use of dport refers to the intended destination of the request.\nproto tcp dport (http https) ACCEPT; We also want to accept SSH connections. I might change this in the future to be over a port other than the default, but for now 22 is good enough!\nproto tcp dport ssh ACCEPT; Everything else is dropped. We also want to allow all outgoing connections, though I might look into changing this eventually and would like to log all outgoing connections at the very least. And since we’re a web server and are not in the business of routing for other machines, we will drop all FOWARD requests.\n\u003c","wordCount":"1905","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ian S.

I was using Traefik in
docker and it was just crapping out, so I gave up after much frustration and
decided to put the server <em>outisde</em> of Docker. Caddy is a very straightforward
server to setup but has a lot of features. Just an aside, I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;shell&rdquo; for
the src type on these blocks because org doesn&rsquo;t know what a <code>Caddyfile</code> type is,
and shell and Caddy share the same comment types (ie <code>#</code> ).</p><h3 id=globals>Globals<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#globals>#</a></h3><p>Here are the global defaults for Caddy. Since Caddy comes with TLS by default,
