My wife has been laboring since yesterday. The midwife and I think it won&amp;rsquo;t be much longer now. What makes this awkward is I just accepted a new job and while the new job is going to throw paternity time at me from day one, I have to get to day one first, which isn&amp;rsquo;t until October 3rd.</description></item><item><title>New Puppy!</title><link>http://example.org/blog/new-puppy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/new-puppy/</guid><description>I got a new puppy today! I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a name for him. He&amp;rsquo;s a Catahoula Leopard dog. That tail is gonna take some getting used to, it&amp;rsquo;s not docked, that&amp;rsquo;s just what they call a &amp;ldquo;bob&amp;rdquo; tail, it&amp;rsquo;s natural and common on this breed.</description></item></channel></rss>
