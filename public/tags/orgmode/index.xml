      <description>Sylvan is a work-in-progress, and probably will never be finished. It was my work towards an ergonomic site-generator for org-mode. I have more or less abandoned it, as I felt constrained by the Uniorg parser, but more to the point, I was concerned with the how of converting it from a very specific and custom site to one that could be used by anyone. I felt like the effort needed to take the Sylvan project to that point was fairly high, and there already existed a few better options.</description>
