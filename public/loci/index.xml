To understand profoundly through intuition or empathy To have or to have acquired an intuitive understanding of; to know (something) without having to think To get the meaning of something &amp;ldquo;Grok&amp;rdquo; is a neologism coined in the book Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein. I&amp;rsquo;ve never read the book, the term is ingrained enough into the world of software that I&amp;rsquo;m confident most people who use the term have never even heard of the book or know the word&amp;rsquo;s origins.</description></item></channel></rss>
