Just wanted to point out that I have removed the 'loci' and the 'projects' links
from the navbar. I am likely going to also remove configs eventually since those
are all literate configs and I am no longer using emacs. I have that up still
for the time being because it has valuable content. The loci and projects
sections had little to no content of value, so I have removed them. The very few
pages are still present, however you can only reach them if you have a link,
there is no way of getting to them from this blog (except maybe a post or two
that links to them). At some future point I will probably bring the digital
garden back, but I currently am using Obsidian and might end up on Logseq, but
either way this Hugo blog has no way of presenting that data.
