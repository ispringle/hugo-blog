I am giving `ox-hugo` another try. A few reasons, primarily, my NextJS efforts
started feeling like holding water in my hands, and second ox-hugo is just
closer to the metal, so to speak. The site will probably change apperance for a
while but I hope to get it back to a close approximation of what I have
style-wise currently. This post will likely be shown on the NextJS version of
the blog for a while and then once I've gotten a deployment process setup I'll
switch to the Hugo site.
