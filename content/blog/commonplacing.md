So, I'm thinking about the concept of digital gardens, the ideas behind
Zettelkasten, and my own interpretation of that I am _currently_ calling "[Grok]({{< relref "#d41d8c" >}})". I
was reading on another _digital garden_ about this historic concept called
"[commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)" or "commonplaces". The idea goes back further to this Latin
term called _locus communis_, and it goes back even further to the Greek idea of
"τόπος κοινός" (topos koinos) or "[literary topos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_topos)". John Locke even wrote a book
on this idea called _[A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books](https://archive.org/details/gu_newmethodmaki00lock)_. I'm interested in
this for a couple reasons; first it's interesting to see that my desire to have
_some place_ to store my ideas is shared with many in antiquity, and second as I
am refining this concept and building on it and how I want to treat it
conceptually as well as in practice, it's handy to see how others, both present
and past, have treated this same sort of concept. I think I ultimately dislike
the Zettelkasten, at least for _me_ because it is too fine-grained and too keyed
into specfic topics. I am not a researcher, I just like a broad array of things
and I enjoy seeing their interconnectedness.

This commonplacing (not sure if that's a coined term or not) idea is something I
find really attractive because instead of being a repository for specfic, well
crafted, and atomic thoughts, it is instead a repository for a myriad of
thoughts, quotes, ideas, and excerpts on a whole array of topics.

Likely, at some future time I will update the name of my digital garden to be
more in tune with this historic concept. We'll see...
