As you can see this site is a serious WIP. But it's coming along, nonetheless --
and dare I say it, is actually useable. Few tasks I'd like to get done next
include:


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> RSS feed(s) {#rss-feed--s}


## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Start rudimentary display of \`/grok\` -- aka the knowledge base {#start-rudimentary-display-of-grok-aka-the-knowledge-base}


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Programmigcally display projects under \`/project\` based on GitHub and GitLab starred projects {#programmigcally-display-projects-under-project-based-on-github-and-gitlab-starred-projects}


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Add a section for my JS and love.js games so they can all be played/explored from this site {#add-a-section-for-my-js-and-love-dot-js-games-so-they-can-all-be-played-explored-from-this-site}


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Better logo/branding/header thing and a favicon that isn't the NextJS default {#better-logo-branding-header-thing-and-a-favicon-that-isn-t-the-nextjs-default}


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Book review index as a gallery of book covers {#book-review-index-as-a-gallery-of-book-covers}


## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Typography improvements including a better font, better colors, and automatically swap quotes and dashes for the appropriate curly quote or emdash, etc. {#typography-improvements-including-a-better-font-better-colors-and-automatically-swap-quotes-and-dashes-for-the-appropriate-curly-quote-or-emdash-etc-dot}

I'd also really love to figure out a way to incorporate Git commits into each
post/review/etc. Basically figure out when the document was added in Git and
that would stand in as my \`date\` and then figure out last modified date/time and
add that as well. And speaking of time... the time values are wrong, I will need
to investigate what is up with the \`date-fns\` library I'm using.
