We may or may not have a new baby in the next few days. My wife has been
laboring since yesterday. The midwife and I think it won't be much longer now.
What makes this awkward is I just accepted a new job and while the new job is
going to throw paternity time at me from day one, I have to get to day one
first, which isn't until October 3rd.

Might make for an interesting next three weeks.
