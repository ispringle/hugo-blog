The [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) is basically an attempt at providing standards and tooling to
create websites that are federated and connected to one another. Some of the
things they have include _IndieAuth_, _Webmentions_, _h-cards_, _h-entries_, and
syndication with _POSSE_. Almost all of these things are just standards that you
can implement on your site, like the _h-\*_ stuff, and allow for other sites and
tools to interact with your own website. Some neat things that this allows for
are mostly automatic "webmentions", which are anything from comments on a post,
to response posts, and "shares". An _h-card_ is basically a business card that
other sites can find in your `<head>`.

Anywho, I had this implemented before on my 0x44.pw website and I am going to
try to really implement the entire catalog of IndieWeb features here on _this_
site in Sylvan. Why? I think it's a cool exercise and allows for some neat
interactions.
