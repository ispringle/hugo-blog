I've been playing with ox-hugo for a few days now. I do like a lot about it. One thing I like a lot is how it is focused on getting out of the way and just turning org files into well crafted HTML. I am rather unpleased with ox-hugo's path for deployment, it's a bit more manual than I like. I tried to automate it but hit a roadblock. I'll definitely be trying this again later because the current solution isn't acceptable to me. This is going to sound weird, but ox-hugo expects you to _know_ all the files you want to publish, whereas Sylvan checks them for you and says "oh this is publishable and this is not." That means that you make the conscience effort to say "publish this" but in the future you do not need to recall back to what was and what wasn't published.
