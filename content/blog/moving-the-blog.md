I did it. This morning I mentioned that I was going to be leaving Emacs land and
moving to VS Code and this afternoon I moved the blog over. It was very easy
actually. I already had a test Hugo blog running on Neocities.org, so all I had
to do was port the few new posts since that effort, and then update my DNS to
point to the Neocities site. I suspect that I will eventually be moving from
Hugo to Astro, like I had previously mentioned, however this is a great stop-gap
and will let me have a blog that I can keep updated without having to do
much/any work to migrate.

I think I might also resurrect the old 0x44.pw site and get that back up with
some handwritten HTML. Probably do something fun and different with that page
and just let it be an outlet for creative expression.

I will probably spend some time tweaking and finalizing the Hugo site's
aesthetic now that I am a bit more committed to using it. I probably will work
on a better CI/CD experience as well, since right not I manually build the site
and push those changes. But maybe I will keep that, we'll have to see...
