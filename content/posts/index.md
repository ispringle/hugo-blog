I am Ian Pringle -- a sinner saved by grace, a husband and father. I
trade in software development and systems engineering. I am also attempting
something that is a mix of homesteading and building a self-reliant community,
and serving others through the land I have been blessed by God with.

You can find my latest [blog posts here](./blog/). I have a "digital garden" that I call
"[loci]({{< relref "loci" >}})" which might be of interest to some people.  I'm also trying to [review
books](./book) that I read, just to sort of keep a record of what I'm reading and
anything I thought about the book after finishing it.
